# Implementation.md

## Project Overview

This project implements a **backend-only Node.js case study** for a Dashboard API.  
It exposes two endpoints:

- **Products Dashboard API** ‚Äì `/dashboard/products`  
- **Visitors Dashboard API** ‚Äì `/dashboard/visitors`  

The APIs support **date range queries** and **bucket-based grouping** (`day`, `week`, `month`).  
The backend is built with **Express.js** and tested using **Postman**.  
No frontend is required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Node.js (v18+)
- Express.js for HTTP server
- Day.js for date manipulation
- Mock dataset for demo purposes (can be replaced with DB integration later)

## Sample Data

**Products**
```json
[
  { "date": "2025-09-01", "added": 5, "removed": 2, "total": 120 },
  { "date": "2025-09-02", "added": 3, "removed": 0, "total": 123 },
  { "date": "2025-09-03", "added": 6, "removed": 1, "total": 128 }
]
```

Visitors

```json

[
  { "date": "2025-09-01", "visits": 50, "total": 50 },
  { "date": "2025-09-02", "visits": 75, "total": 125 },
  { "date": "2025-09-03", "visits": 40, "total": 165 }
]
```

üß∞ Utilities ‚Äì bucketUtils.js

The utility file is responsible for grouping raw data into buckets (day, week, month).
It uses Day.js with plugins (isoWeek, isSameOrAfter, isSameOrBefore) for date handling.

üîß How It Works

Date Filtering
- If startDate is provided ‚Üí keeps only records on/after that date.
- If endDate is provided ‚Üí keeps only records on/before that date.

Day Bucket
- Returns records one per day, with exact startDate and endDate.

Week Bucket

- Groups all entries from the same ISO week (Monday‚ÄìSunday).
- Aggregates totals (added, removed, visits).
- Sets startDate to week start and endDate to week end.


Month Bucket

- Groups all entries from the same calendar month.
- Aggregates totals and sets startDate/endDate to the first and last day of the month.


 Products Dashboard

Endpoint:
GET /dashboard/products

Sample Response (bucket=day):
```json
{
  "currentTotal": 128,
  "buckets": [
    {
      "startDate": "2025-09-01",
      "endDate": "2025-09-01",
      "added": 5,
      "removed": 2,
      "total": 120
    },
    {
      "startDate": "2025-09-02",
      "endDate": "2025-09-02",
      "added": 3,
      "removed": 0,
      "total": 123
    }
  ]
}





````
 Visitors Dashboard

Endpoint:

GET /dashboard/visitors
Sample Response (bucket=week):
```json
{
  "currentTotal": 165,
  "buckets": [
    {
      "startDate": "2025-09-01",
      "endDate": "2025-09-07",
      "visits": 165,
      "total": 165
    }
  ]
}



```

Bucket Logic
- Implemented in utils/bucketUtils.js
- Day bucket ‚Üí groups per day
- Week bucket ‚Üí groups per week (Monday‚ÄìSunday)
- Month bucket ‚Üí groups per calendar month
- Each bucket response includes startDate and endDate

 
 How to Run

Install dependencies:
npm install

How to Test

Products by day:
GET http://localhost:8000/dashboard/products?bucket=day
